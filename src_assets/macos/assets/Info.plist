  Setting values for NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription and NSBonjourServices may
  be required to access the local network according to the documentation:
    https://developer.apple.com/documentation/technotes/tn3179-understanding-local-network-privacy

  In practice, they don't actually seem to be required in all circumstances,
  but they may be required in some circumstances, and it doesn't hurt to have
  them set here.
